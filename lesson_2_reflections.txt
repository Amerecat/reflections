What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the .git hidden file. This will then allow you to track the version history of each file in that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is kind of like the area you get to start working on something and essentially, you begin tracking each and every logical change you make. With that, I get to see all changes made to my file 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	you can run "git diff" to see each change made. All work done to files are placed in the working area before they can be sent to the staging area. In the staging area the files can then be checked with the repository files via "git diff --staged". Any work that you you dont want can be removed and adjusted accordingly

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	1) when I want to experiment with something but dont want it to affect my master files
	2) it helps when I want to locate a specific part in my work and then work from there
	3) I can narrow down exactly what might have caused changes/bugs to appear in my files
