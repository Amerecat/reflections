When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's when you intend to collaborate with others or excess files from somewhere other than your local drive

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This is because, just like when pushing, you might not be ready or might not want to adopt the changes on Github onto your local repository just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - only used or occurs on GitHub when cloning a respository. This is useful when you dont have permission to make changes to the original repository

    Clones - occurs on the local respository or when copying from a remote respository to the local repository. This is useful when synching between remote and local repository

    Branches - occurs on the local respository. Useful when you want to try something or collaborate with someone without affecting the master branch. Can be combined or added to the master branch when you want or need to

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
